# Godot Duke
Just a little test loading Duke Nukem 3d map files.
I was having a look at converting duke nukem maps to work with LPortal, however although the maps were easy to convert it looked quite time consuming to convert to something usable.

Ken Silverman's source, while brilliant, I found inpenetrable for an outsider with the lack of comments and variable names. I had more luck with Fabian Sanglard's version.

I may revisit this.
